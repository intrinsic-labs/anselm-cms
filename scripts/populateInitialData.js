We will study doctrine and seek to understand the depths of Scripture. But more than that, the daily life at Anselm will be centered around Scripture, prayer, and knowledge of God in all subjects.'

The end for which education exists is to make students critical thinkers, virtuous human beings, and those who love the true, good, and beautiful. If education was merely a transactional relationship between teachers and students in which there is a transfer of head knowledge and facts alone, artificial intelligence can fill this role. Rather, classical education is aimed at the heart and soul of a student, not only the head. We desire our students to be constant learners that will lead them to live the good life in light of Christ.'

Rightly so, this has caused many schools to swing in the opposite direction and focus solely on academic rigor. While the inclination to challenge the minds of students is a good thing, it can often come at the expense of joy. If students have lost the joy of learning from having too many homework assignments or intense lectures, we have failed at the task education seeks to accomplish: learning wisdom and virtue with joy. The Anselm School exists in the space of academic firmness that is joyfully encountered.'
